## Quality Control/Assurance (QC)

QC is performed at various stages of the dHCP analysis as listed below. The
final selection of subject data to release made use of these as outlined
subsequently.

## Stages of QC  

1. After reconstruction the T2, T1, T13D, fMRI and dMRI datasets were visually 
inspected and each of them was flagged as PASS/FAIL.

2. The fMRI pipeline generates a number of QC metrics which are described on the
[Functional Pipeline](fmri.md#fmri-qc) page. 

3. The diffusion pipeline I generates a number of QC metrics which are described
on the [Diffusion Pipeline I](dwi.md#diffusion-mri-qc) page.

4. The diffusion pipeline II generates a number of QC metrics which are described
on the [Diffusion Pipeline II](dwi-shard.md#diffusion-mri-qc) page.

The inclusion criteria for reconstructed raw data is:

The inclusion criteria for fMRI data is:

The inclusion criteria for dMRI data is:
