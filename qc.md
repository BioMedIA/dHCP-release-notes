## Quality Control/Assurance (QC)

QC is performed at various stages of the dHCP analysis as listed below. The
final selection of subject data to release made use of these as outlined
subsequently.

1. After reconstruction the T2, T1, T13D, fMRI and dMRI datasets were visually 
inspected and each of them was flagged as PASS/FAIL.

2. The fMRI pipeline and diffusion pipelines generate numerous quantitative QC metrics which are described on their respective pages:
   1. [Functional Pipeline](fmri.md#fmri-qc)
   2. [Diffusion Pipeline I](dwi.md#diffusion-mri-qc)
   3. [Diffusion Pipeline II](dwi-shard.md#diffusion-mri-qc)
