## Data download update (Oct 2023)

Please follow this guideline for downloading data from NDA.

## Third Data Release

We would like to announce the third release of data as part of the Developing
Human Connectome Project (dHCP) – an ERC-funded collaboration between
King’s College London, Imperial College London and University of Oxford.

This is the project’s third open access data release which consists of
images of 783 neonatal subjects (886 datasets). The imaging data includes structural imaging,
structural connectivity data (diffusion MRI) and functional connectivity
data (resting-state fMRI). This data release comes with minimal accompanying
metadata: sex, age at birth, age at scan, birthweight, head circumference
and radiology score. More specific information about the available data
can be found in the [data organisation notes](organisation.html). To
access the data you will be required to agree to a simple [data sharing
agreement](http://www.developingconnectome.org/open-access-dhcp-data-terms-of-use-version-4-0_2019-05-23/)
and will then be provided with access routes to two different modes of
data download.

We invite colleagues in the field to explore and
[feedback](https://neurostars.org/tags/developing-hcp) on the value and
characteristics of the image dataset. The image data have been processed
using analysis pipelines that are subject to further development.  If you
use this data or the pipelines please cite the appropriate publications as
detailed in the [How to cite](cite.html) notes.

The project to date has successfully completed over 800 neonatal scans and
300 fetal scans. Further
data releases are planned - these will be announced on the dHCP website
when they are ready.

## Acknowledgments

The research leading to these data has received funding from the European
Research Council under the European Union Seventh Framework Programme
(FP/20072013)/ERC Grant Agreement no. 319456. The work was also supported
by the NIHR Biomedical Research Centres at Guys and St Thomas NHS Trust.
We are grateful to the families who generously supported this trial. 
We would like to acknowledge Core support for data acquisition was provided 
by the Wellcome/EPSRC Centre for Medical Engineering [WT 203148/Z/16/Z]. We are
also thankful to the WU-Minn-Oxford Human Connectome Project consortium
(1U54MH091657-01) for access to their computing resources.

Study data were collected and managed using REDCap electronic data capture
tools hosted at King's College, London.

REDCap (Research Electronic Data Capture) is a secure, web-based software
platform designed to support data capture for research studies, providing
1) an intuitive interface for validated data capture; 2) audit trails
for tracking data manipulation and export procedures; 3) automated export
procedures for seamless data downloads to common statistical packages; and 4)
procedures for data integration and interoperability with external sources.
