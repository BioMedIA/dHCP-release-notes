The third data release in currently underway. 

Data that are available now:
- Neonatal data: native and processed. Structural, DTI, fMRI.
- Fetal data: native and processed. Structural, DTI, fMRI.
- Clinical information about pregnancy and birth.
- Genomics.
- Eye-tracking data at 18 months of age.

Upcoming data (pending NDA approval):
- Neurodevelopmental outcome at 18 months of age.

## HOW TO ACCESS AND DOWNLOAD THE DATA:
All data are uploaded on the [NDA website](https://nda.nih.gov/edit_collection.html?id=3955). The NDA is responsible for all data governance. Please follow the guidelines below on how to request access and download the data:

## Third Data Release

We would like to announce the third release of data as part of the Developing
Human Connectome Project (dHCP) – an ERC-funded collaboration between
King’s College London, Imperial College London and University of Oxford.

This is the project’s third open access data release which consists of
images of 783 neonatal subjects (886 datasets). The imaging data includes structural imaging,
structural connectivity data (diffusion MRI) and functional connectivity
data (resting-state fMRI). This data release comes with minimal accompanying
metadata: sex, age at birth, age at scan, birthweight, head circumference
and radiology score. More specific information about the available data
can be found in the [data organisation notes](organisation.html). 

We invite colleagues in the field to explore and
[feedback](https://neurostars.org/tags/developing-hcp) on the value and
characteristics of the image dataset. The image data have been processed
using analysis pipelines that are subject to further development.  If you
use this data or the pipelines please cite the appropriate publications as
detailed in the [How to cite](cite.html) notes.
